# MindfulU
Getting Started
To begin, download the files and import them into Android Studio. Once done, you can run the application straight away.

## Description
MindfulU is an app designed to provide support during the interim period between securing a therapist appointment and the actual visit. It functions as a companion app that offers a non-intrusive, compassionate, and supportive space while awaiting professional help. Note: It complements, but does not replace, therapeutic solutions.

## Future Plans
Our roadmap includes diversifying the app experience with additional games and features. We're also looking forward to integrating Spotify to enhance notifications and personalise the gamification aspect.

## Project Status
MindfulU began as a school project. Its future development will depend on the level of interest and engagement it receives.
